# ParkingLot
An auto generate -  car ticketing program
The project is an automated ticketing system that allows customers to use parking lot without human intervention. As cars request to park in the parking lot, a search is made to find the closest slot and allot that car to that slot. The project also lets one know in which slot a car is parked, the overall status of the parking lot, registration number of cars that are of one color. The project is designed specifically to handle such queries with ease.
